In Japan, government policies have significantly expanded graduate school enrollment, quadrupling the number of graduate students over the past 40 years. This study estimates the wage premium of graduate education using data from four surveys, considering factors such as undergraduate major, type and rank of university, cognitive abilities, and parental education. Results show that even after accounting for these factors, the graduate wage premium is positive and significant, ranging from 14.7% to 23.7% for men and from 13.5% to 26.4% for women.
