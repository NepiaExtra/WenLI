Using microdata collected from the JHPS and the KHPS, this study examines the relation between married couples’ relative incomes and their respective reports of subjective well-being. The sampled data were divided into four groups according to the husbands’ and wives’ income patterns. Estimation results revealed that, in a scenario where traditional gender norms are maintained, a wife with higher potential income than her husband is less likely to be happy and less satisfied with life overall and household finances. The results also showed that a wife who realized her high wage potential was more likely to report unhappiness and low life satisfaction than a wife who earned less than her husband based on the traditional gender role, although they showed no dissatisfaction with household finances.
